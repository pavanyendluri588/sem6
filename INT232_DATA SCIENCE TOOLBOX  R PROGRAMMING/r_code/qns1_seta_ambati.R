Sure, I can help you create an appropriate data object to save the results from the mtcars dataset using SQLDF and other functions. Here are the solutions:
     
     First, we need to load the mtcars dataset and SQLDF package:
     
     R
Copy code
library(mtcars)
library(sqldf)
a) From the mtcars dataset, save the number of cars having mileage less than 15 using SQLDF:
     
     R
Copy code
Mpg_below_15 <- sqldf("SELECT COUNT(*) AS No_of_cars FROM mtcars WHERE mpg < 15")
b) From the mtcars dataset, save the names of cars that have cyl=4 and having horsepower above 105 using SQLDF:
     
     R
Copy code
Hp_above_105 <- sqldf("SELECT DISTINCT(car) FROM mtcars WHERE cyl = 4 AND hp > 105")
c) Save the mean of displacement from mtcars:
     
     R
Copy code
Mean_displacement <- mean(mtcars$disp)
d) Find the correlation of every attribute with other attribute:
     
     R
Copy code
Correlation_all <- cor(mtcars)
Finally, save the outputs of above parts in one data object with the appropriate name (Mpg_below_15, Hp_above_105, Mean_displacement and Correlation_all) so that they can be accessed easily in future from the names:
     
     R
Copy code
Results <- list(Mpg_below_15 = Mpg_below_15,
                Hp_above_105 = Hp_above_105,
                Mean_displacement = Mean_displacement,
                Correlation_all = Correlation_all)
Now, you can access each result using its corresponding name from the Results object:
     
     R
Copy code
Results$Mpg_below_15
Results$Hp_above_105
Results$Mean_displacement
Results$Correlation_all
Hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
